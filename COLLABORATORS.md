# Collaboration Acknowledgments

Python 3 Documentation | https://docs.python.org/3/ | The cornerstone of my programming foundation. Diving into Python's official docs was like having a map in a vast coding wilderness, guiding me through syntax jungles and library labyrinths.

Stack Overflow | https://stackoverflow.com | No less than a council of wise sages, always ready with a solution or a word of advice. Whether I faced a bug as elusive as a ghost or a logic puzzle as knotty as an ancient oak, this community was my roundtable of troubleshooters.

Pandas Documentation | https://pandas.pydata.org/docs/user_guide/index.html | My ally in the data manipulation arena. Pandas' documentation was a masterclass in wrangling dataframes, transforming my approach to data analysis and making every challenge a bit more surmountable.

PyMuPDF GitHub Discussions | https://github.com/pymupdf/PyMuPDF/discussions | The craftsmen behind the tools I used to extract data from PDFs. Their discussions were a workshop where I honed my skills, learning to carve out the information I needed from the densest of documents.

Historical weather API | https://open-meteo.com/en/docs/historical-weather-api#hourly=temperature_2m,precipitation,weather_code&location_mode=csv_coordinates | Went through this documentation which helped me in geeting WMO code for a location.
